    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>
      I am a senior at oakland University studying Information Technology. I am
      22 years old and from Warren, Michigan. I've always had a passion for
      technology and given a lot of time in learning more about it over the
      years. Currently I am working at an IT helpdesk where I assist people by
      troubleshooting different technology issues. Before here I worked as an IT
      intern at a company called Healthmetryx. Here I worked with a team and
      found solutions for different technical problems. In the future I'd like
      to become a cybersecurity analyst. If you'd like to know more about me
